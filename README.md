# ds-visualizer

open-source data-structures visualizer with lots of customizable inputs for learning purposes.

## purpose

- provide a space for those who rely on visual learning to deeply understand data structures and their implementations.
- master unit testing and achieve near-to-100% test coverage through TTD.
- learn and utilize a JS data visualization library.

## tech stack (frontend-focused)

- typescript/react.js/daisyui
- testing: vitest + react-testing library
- data-visualization library: d3.js

## what I'm testing

- component rendering: Ensure components render correctly with different props
- user interactions: Test that components respond correctly to user actions
- state changes: Verify that component state updates as expected
- integration between components: Test how components work together
- edge cases: Test how components behave with unexpected or boundary input
